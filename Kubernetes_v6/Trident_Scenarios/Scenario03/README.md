# SCENARIO 3: Navigate through Prometheus and Grafana
#########################################################################################

**GOAL:**  
This lab is already equipped with Prometheus & Grafana, which were installed with Helm.  
Let's check the configuration and add a few items, such as NetApp Harvest which is used to collect data from ONTAP, and is integrated with Prometheus.  

The scenario has been divided into 3 steps:
- [Prometheus](1_Prometheus): Navigate through Prometheus  
- [Grafana](2_Grafana): Navigate through Grafana  
- [Harvest](3_Harvest): Integrating with NetApp Harvest
